        <h2> Halo: Scratch Edition</h3>
        <br>
        <h3> Description</h3>
        <br>
        <p> This game is an active game based off of the Halo Series. The game</p>
        <p> can be seen as the very primitive version of Halo, as Scratch is unable </p>
        <p> to support true first/third person gameplay of Halo. It utilizes a score</p>
        <p> based off of how many aliens you have killed with your laser gun, and </p>
        <p> if you reach the score of 100, you would win. However, you have health,</p>
        <p> and the health hitting 0 means you would lose. The aliens spawn </p>
        <p> randomly across the right side of the screen, and they will progressively</p>
        <p> get more and more agressive to try and kill you.</p>

        <h3> The Homepage of the Game</h3>
        <p> Some obvious successes with the game is the optimal balancing of the game</p>
        <p> and the functioning of the bullets. With the help of prior experience, I was</p>
        <p> able to properly create code that properly made the bullets function and the </p>
        <p> game not as unfair.</p>

        <h3> Some Gameplay</h3>
        <p> Some obstacles that were present while creating the game was the optimal balancing</p>
        <p> of the entire game, as I had to constantly fiddle with the code in order to </p>
        <p> create a sense of reward for optimal plays while punishing poor plays.</p>
        <p> Another ostacle present was the fact that the images had to constantly be imported </p>
        <p> over from another website and remodeled in order to be functional. I overcame</p>
        <p> both these obstacles by accepting the fact that I had nearly no time to sleep,</p>
        <p> and i just had to manually add and edit all of the scripts.</p>
        <br>

        <h3> A Special Program </h3>
        <br>
        <p> This is an example of a script I used. It was used for the enemies you would </p>
        <p> encounter in the game, as it would move te enemy across the stage and dissapear </p>
        <p> based off of where it is or what it is interacting with. It is with certainty to say it is </p>
        <p> an algorithim due to how it utilizes multiple scripts in order to fufill the</p>
        <p> purpose of the game engine. Also, it functions as a more block due to how it </p>
        <p> uses multiple scripts into one compactc script as to simplify and reduce</p>
        <p> the repetition in the code.</p>
        <br>
        <h3> What if I Had More Time?</h3>
        <br>
        <p> If I had more time, I would have utilized a reset button that would not break the other</p>
        <p> scripts within the program. Although I had a soft reset button that would relaunch the</p>
        <p> gameplay, it causes a fatal error where the bullets don't work as intended. I would have</p>
        <p> also attempted to fix the hitboxes of the aliens, as they may be grazed by the bullets</p>
        <p> or be hitting the player without disappearing. The healt bar could also be replaced with</p>
        <p> improved visual.</p>
